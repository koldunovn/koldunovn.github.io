Hi, I’m Nikolay Koldunov - an oceanographer and climate scientist working to understanding our planet’s dynamics and making complex climate data accessible to everyone. I use high-resolution models (and recently, AI) on supercomputers to predict and analyze climate change. 

At the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de/), I focus on high-resolution climate modeling, developing systems powered by large language models, and experimenting with AI-based weather and climate models. I also enjoy creating data visualizations and teaching. Check out the links above to learn more!
